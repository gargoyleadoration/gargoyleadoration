 <summary>${\color{#575b66}Gargoyles}$ ${\color{#575b66}VS}$ ${\color{#575b66}Grotesques}$</summary>
  They may look similar, but they could not serve a different purpose. Gargoyles are the ones built to serve a purpose, grotesques are meant to be purely decorational. In architecture, a grotesque refers to a carved stone figure, while a gargoyle refers to a carved figure designed for the purpose of draining water from the sides of a building. These two are often mistaken for each other.

These are some examples of grotesques! These are not designed to drain water as there are either no open mouths or no water channel!

These are examples of gargoyles! The first one shows the water channel, and thats why they don't have anything on their backs! They always have their mouths open (though in a specific gargoyle's case on the wikipedia, its asshole..)

And now you know how to tell the difference betweena gargoyle and grotesque!!
